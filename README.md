# [IU-F18] Differential Equation, Computational Practicum - Approximating solutions numerically
This repository contains my submission to the computational practicum assignment as part of the Differential Equation course in Innopolis University in Fall 2018. Kindly find the .pdf file in this repository which will give a comprehensive information about the program implemented here.

You can find and fiddle around with the implemented program online at https://kckusal.github.io/IU-F18_Differential-Equation_Computational-Practicum_Approximating-solutions-numerically

Also, feel free to pull issues, should you find any. I will not be working with this project anymore, but I will be glad to know that someone still cares about it!
